## Democrats.org Remake

This is a remake of [Democrats.org](https://democrats.org), official website of the United States Democratic Party.

Frameworks & libraries used:

- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) - for data linking & routing
- [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) - for cross-browser consistency
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.io/) - for social media icon styling
- [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) - for style & script bundling


#### Build Setup

To try it yourself, download it to your local drive, open a terminal inside the directory and go through the following steps:

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

You can check the official [docs for vue-loader](https://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader) for detailed explanation on how things work.
